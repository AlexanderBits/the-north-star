# The North Star: Settings for ProfitTrailer 2 and PTMagic 1.6
These are ProfitTrailer and [PTMagic](http://www.profit-trailer-magic.com) settings that specialize in trading in various market conditions. They have surgical entry points with gentle low-risk exits. The settings feature responsibly tiered DCA levels that are executed only when the market signals us its time to double down.

The settings bring clarity and focus. In a sea of opinions, clich√©s, and lackluster settings, we welcome you to The North Star.
